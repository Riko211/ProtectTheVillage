# ProtectTheVillage

## Gameplay
The gameplay of the game is to protect the village from endless waves of monsters that get stronger as you progress. 
To destroy monsters, you can use melee weapons (sword) and long-range weapons (machine gun, sniper rifle, flamethrower, etc.) and magic (fireball and ice spears).

## Bosses 
Every 5th wave, one or more bosses will spawn at the end of the battle. Also bosses have a small chance to spawn at the end of each wave. When killing the boss, you can get crystals to improve magic.

## Magic
There are currently 2 types of magic: fireball and ice spears. A fireball is fired at the nearest enemy and deals damage in an area around the explosion. Ice spears also fly at nearby enemies and, if they hit an enemy, will damage them and freeze them for a while, depending on the level of improvement. When frozen, monsters are temporarily stunned and stop moving and attacking.

## Character progression
The higher the monster wave number, the more health and damage the monsters have. If the waves are too difficult, you can replay the previous ones in order to earn money, experience and crystals to improve your character.  
There are 3 types of currency in the game: coins, experience and crystals. Coins and experience can be obtained by killing monsters. Crystals - killing bosses.
Coins can be used to buy and upgrade weapons from an arms dealer. For crystals - buy and improve magic from the magician. And for experience, improve character characteristics such as maximum health and regeneration speed.
